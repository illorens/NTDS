    "The purpose of this milestone is to start getting acquainted to the network that you will use for this class. In the first part of the milestone you will import your data using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and you will create the adjacency matrix using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org). This part is project specific. In the second part you will have to compute some basic properties of your network. **For the computation of the properties you are only allowed to use the packages that have been imported in the cell below.** You are not allowed to use any graph-specific toolboxes for this milestone (such as networkx and PyGSP). Furthermore, the aim is not to blindly compute the network properties, but to also start to think about what kind of network you will be working with this semester. "

However, its biggest connected component is almost the size of the full graph and leaves only 90 other nodes that are not connected to it. Since there are 90 other components and 90 other nodes that need accounting for, this suggests that the 90 other nodes (movies) are disconnected from any other node.

The first element is indeed a matrix, however the other 90 elements are empty arrays with shape (1,0). \n",
