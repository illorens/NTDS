    "The purpose of this milestone is to start getting acquainted to the network that you will use for this class. In the first part of the milestone you will import your data using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and you will create the adjacency matrix using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org). This part is project specific. In the second part you will have to compute some basic properties of your network. **For the computation of the properties you are only allowed to use the packages that have been imported in the cell below.** You are not allowed to use any graph-specific toolboxes for this milestone (such as networkx and PyGSP). Furthermore, the aim is not to blindly compute the network properties, but to also start to think about what kind of network you will be working with this semester. "

NEWMAN: Networks: An Introduction (Page 137, Eq: 6.31)). However, for an undirected graph this will give us the number of walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A walk is defined as a way of going from start to end by taking any possible path (including loops and repeating edges). The definition of walk corresponds to our definition of path. We can then use this method for undirected graphs within this course. \n",
